    <!--3 ways to use CSS
    1.inline styling
    2. Css Selectors-is an additional piece of information that tells CSS to which element inside your Dom, so inside the <body></body> that you want to assign the delcaration.better alternative than inline. you add a selector by simply adding the tag name w/o <> so in our case it will be section-->
    <!--normal html tag <style></style>inside the style tag you write Css rules you simply add a selector by-->
    <!--selector-section,CSS rule-background: #ff1b68--->
    <!--another way to adding styles is using an external stylesheet-->
  </head>

  <body>
    <main>
      <!--adding inline styling by add in the style attribute to the section. the style attribute is a normal html attribute that can be added to pretty much every html element. you can set a Css style by applying a CSS declaration inside of the style attribute or string you pass as an argument. A decalaration means you define what you want to style and how you want to style it. "background is property and red is the value" #-for hex code. you can. Inline styling is not recommened because if you take a bigger approach, create a bigger page with many styles it quickly becomes very hard to understand and read your code<section style="background: #ff1b68">
        <h1>Get the freedom you deserve</h1>
      </section>.A better way to style CSS is with selector-->
      <section id="product-overview">
        <!--assign ids to the tags.ids are not an attribute. you only add because you want to style the element.ids
      also allow to add # at the end of your url and the browser will jump down to that element on the page.-->
        <h1>Get the freedom you deserve.</h1>
      </section>
      <section id="plans">
        <h1 class="section-title">Choose Your Plan</h1>
        <!--kebab case;lower case-separated with dashes, because css is case sensitive-->
      </section>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>

<!---More about Selectors
Elements-Set equal style for these elements
<html>
  <h1>Our header </h1>
  <p>The Blog Post</p>
  <div>More Info</div>
CSS
h1 {
  color: red;
}
Classes(selectors)-define a style that we apply to all
elements that have the same class. A class is added
to html by adding a class attribute:
<h1 class="blog-post">
  Our header</h1>
  The blog post</p>
  <div class="blog-post"> free to choose any class name I want
    More info</div>
    Css class will look like this:
    .blog-post { all html elements that has this class will get the
      red text color.
      color: red;(declaration in the css rule)
    }
    To set a style for all elements on the page,
    you will use the Universal selector.
    Universal: example one with a class and another w/o a class,
    the top two rules wouldn't apply. the only rule we will be able to turn
    everything the same color would be *:
    <html>
    <h1>Our header</h1>
    <p class="blog-post"> The blog post</p>
    Css
    Universal-selector
    * { --- with the * selector you style everything on your page. you rarely use this one because you don't want all the same style on your page. 
      color: red;
    }
  2 more selectors
IDs-allow you to select elements by the id they have, then
apply style to that one specific element.Since id only exist once on a page we only apply style to one single element
in <html> it will look:
  <h1 id="main-title">Our header</h1>
  Css targeted to add # in front of the id name:
  #main-title {
    color: red;
  }
Last type of  main selectors are attribute selectors.with
this you select html elements by the attribute they have and can 
select multiple elements on the id selector,which only select one.
in<html>
  button disabled(attribute)>
  Click
</button>(standard html button attribute)
in Css you will select all buttons or all elements with disabled attributes
by inclosing the attribute name in square brackets(just a syntax that Css uses
and then assigning your delcarations
[disabled] { this css code would assign  a red text
  to all elements no matter if they are buttons or not,
  which have a disabled attribute.
  color: red;
}--->
